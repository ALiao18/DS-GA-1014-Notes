This repo contains course notes for Fall 2025 Optimization and Linear Algebra DS-GA 1014, taught by Florentin Guth. 
The course is a proof-based and the first 2/3 is on linear algebra while the last 1/3 is on optimization. 
Notes were typed in Obsidian, latex suite, so some formulas may not be rendered correctly in github. I will update these slowly. 

Topics:
1. vector spaces
2. linear transformations
3. matrix rank
4. norms, inner products and orthogonality
5. orthogonal matrices
6. eigenvalues and markov chains
7. spectral theorem, principal component analysis
8. singular value decomposition and linear algebra for graphs
9. convexity
10. linear regression
11. optimality conditions
12. gradient descent
