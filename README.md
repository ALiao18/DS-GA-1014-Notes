# DS-GA 1014: Optimization and Linear Algebra (Fall 2025)

**Instructor:** Florentin Guth

Course notes for a proof-based course covering linear algebra (first 2/3) and optimization (last 1/3).

> **Note:** Notes were typed in Obsidian with LaTeX suite. Some formulas may not render correctly on GitHub. Updates coming gradually.

## Topics

1. Vector spaces (vector spaces, span and linear families, basis and dimension)
2. Linear transformations and matrices (linear transformations, matrices, kernel and images, Gaussian elimination)
3. Matrix rank (rank, rank-nullity theorem, rank and invertible matrices, transpose)
4. Norms, inner products, and orthogonality
5. Orthogonal matrices (Gram-Schmidt algorithm, orthogonal matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors)
6. Eigenvalues and Markov chains
7. Spectral theorem and principal component analysis
8. Singular value decomposition and linear algebra for graphs (SVD, graphs and graph Laplacian, spectral clustering)
9. Convexity (functions of multiple variables, convexity definitions, convexity and derivatives, Jensen's inequality)
10. Linear regression (OLS, penalized linear regression, matrix norms)
11. Optimality conditions *(coming soon)*
12. Gradient descent *(coming soon)*
