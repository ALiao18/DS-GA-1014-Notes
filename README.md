This repo contains course notes for Fall 2025 Optimization and Linear Algebra DS-GA 1014, taught by Florentin Guth. 
The course is a proof-based and the first 2/3 is on linear algebra while the last 1/3 is on optimization. 
Notes were typed in Obsidian, latex suite, so some formulas may not be rendered correctly in github. I will update these slowly. 

Topics:
1. vector spaces (vector spaces, span and linear families, basis and dimension)
2. linear transformations and matrices (linear transformations, matrices, kernel and images, gaussian elimination)
3. matrix rank (rank, rank-nullility theorem, rank and invertible matrices, transpose)
4. norms, inner products and orthogonality 
5. orthogonal matrices (Gram-Schmidt algorithm, orthogonal matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors)
6. eigenvalues and markov chains 
7. spectral theorem, principal component analysis 
8. singular value decomposition and linear algebra for graphs (SVD, graphs and graph Laplacian, spectral clustering)
9. convexity (functions of multiple variables, convexity definitions, convexity and derivatives, Jensen's inequality)
10. linear regression (OLS, penalized linear regression, matrix norms)
11. optimality conditions (coming!)
12. gradient descent (coming!)
